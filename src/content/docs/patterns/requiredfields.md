## Error Validation Usage
### ✔️ What to do
- Always provide instructions that explain your required field formatting to users.
- Label optional fields as "optional".
- Use the required attribute for all required form elements.
- Skip required field indicators for single-input forms and login pages.

### ❌ What not to do
- Do not use symbols without explaining what they mean.
- Do not mix and match required field indicators in the same design.


## Usage Guidance
### Should you use an astersk
![Flow chart where user hits submit on a form and form validation error populates](src/assets/error validation 1.png)
The default pattern for validation is after a user performs an action in a form, such as 'Continue', 'Save,' or 'Submit'. In most cases, this action is triggered by a button.
### 👍 Use an asterisk when..
USWDS guidance on forms (Form | USWDS) recommends tagging required fields using a red asterisk. If you're working on a design that leans heavily on USWDS, it is recommended that you follow that pattern.

### 👎 Don't use an asterisk...
If cognitive accessibility or low-tech literacy are concerns for your project, the asterisk may not be a familiar symbol. Instead of an asterisk, it is helpful to spell out requirements in content:

#### What to use instead 
- Example instructions: "All fields are required unless marked optional."
- Example label: "Name (required)".

While familiar to a lot of users, an asterisk is still a symbol that has implicit meaning. When considering cognitive accessibility, it is helpful to clearly explain implied content when possible.
